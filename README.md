# hello-world

Hello everyone!

My name is Kevin and am currently going to Roane State Community College for my AAS in
Computer Programming. I started out just wanting to learn more about computer software
and ended up falling in love with Web Development/Design. I have learned HTML and CSS
so far. I still have a Javascript course to take. However, I have been trying to learn
Javascript on my own before the class and have discovered jQuery in the process.
